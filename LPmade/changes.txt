v1.2.2
- Fixed issue with auroc on 32-bit architectures that caused integer
  wraparounds that produced incorrect results.

v1.2.1
- Fixed issue related to Ubuntu g++ header inclusion.
- Fixed issue related to the specific command "predict -n 0 -d I" that would
  cause existing edges to receive predictions.

v1.2.0
- Changed Makefile.paths to Makefile.options.
- Preliminary support for vertex collocation profile (VCP) make target (make vcp).
- Generalization of WEKA classification support from the classify target to any target requiring classification (such as vcp).
- Changed BAGS user variable in Makefile.common to NUM_BAGS.
- Changed default EVALUATION_METRICS value to "roc auroc aupr".
- Enforced use of bash by GNU make by setting shell variable.
- Added SHELLOPTS export in Makefile.options and added errexit option.

v1.1.2
- Added this change log.
- Changed link predictor score output from 6 to 15 points of precision. Need to modify label_predictions binary to do the same.
- Link predictor score output precision is specified as a maximum precision rather than a required precision.
- Increased the speed of the Katz predictor.
- Preliminarily added vertex collocation profile (VCP) predictors to LPmade. Currently, these predictors output their vectors to standard error and -1 to standard output. Need to better incorporate VCPs, include them in build system, and include documentation.
